#### What is CAL-ACCESS?

The system that handles the collection, processing, and disclosure of California's campaign finance and lobbying filings.

CAL-ACCESS subsystems are:

- the Elecronic Filing Subsystem - accepts electronic filings and also notifies the submitter about the processed results, including asking for corrections.
- Agency Managemnt Subsystem - does PRD business logic, including accounting recores and reports
- Disclosure Subsystem - makes the processed filing data available to the Internet

When you understand the CAL-ACCESS data-flow, you will, according to the PRD, attain the "recognition that the data in the system is not pristine and data may not be available to conduct the requested analysis."
